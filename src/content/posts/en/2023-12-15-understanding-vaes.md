# Understanding Variational Autoencoders

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models that combine ideas from deep learning and Bayesian inference. In this post, we'll explore the mathematical foundations and practical implementation details.

## The Basic Idea

VAEs learn to encode data into a latent representation and decode it back, but with a probabilistic twist that allows for generation of new samples.

## Mathematical Foundation

The core objective of a VAE is to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO):

```
ELBO = E[log p(x|z)] - KL[q(z|x) || p(z)]
```

Where:
- `p(x|z)` is the decoder
- `q(z|x)` is the encoder
- `p(z)` is the prior (typically a standard Gaussian)

## Implementation Details

Here's a simple implementation in PyTorch:

```python
class VAE(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, latent_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, 400),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(400, 2 * latent_dim)  # mean and log variance
        )
        self.decoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(latent_dim, 400),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(400, input_dim)
        )
```

## Applications

VAEs have found applications in:
- Image generation
- Data compression
- Anomaly detection
- Semi-supervised learning

## Conclusion

VAEs provide an elegant framework for generative modeling with solid theoretical foundations and practical applications.
