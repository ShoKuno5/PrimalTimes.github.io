# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

## Types of Machine Learning

Machine learning can be categorized into several types based on the learning approach and the nature of the feedback provided to the learning system.

### Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, algorithms learn from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data. The goal is to map inputs to correct outputs.

Common algorithms include:
- Linear and logistic regression
- Decision trees and random forests
- Support vector machines
- Neural networks

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. The system tries to learn the underlying structure of the data.

Key techniques:
- Clustering (K-means, hierarchical clustering)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
- Association rule learning

### Reinforcement Learning

In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

Applications include:
- Game playing (chess, Go, video games)
- Robotics and autonomous systems
- Resource allocation and scheduling

## The Machine Learning Pipeline

A typical ML project follows these steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering relevant data from various sources
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis
3. **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and creating relevant features
4. **Model Selection**: Choosing appropriate algorithms
5. **Training**: Learning from the training data
6. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance
7. **Deployment**: Putting the model into production

## Evaluation Metrics

Different problems require different evaluation approaches:
- **Classification**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- **Regression**: Mean squared error, mean absolute error, RÂ²
- **Clustering**: Silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index

## Common Challenges

ML practitioners often face several challenges:
- **Overfitting**: Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- **Underfitting**: Model is too simple to capture underlying patterns
- **Data quality**: Dealing with missing, inconsistent, or biased data
- **Feature selection**: Choosing the most relevant features
- **Scalability**: Handling large datasets efficiently

Understanding these fundamentals provides a solid foundation for diving deeper into specific machine learning techniques and applications.
