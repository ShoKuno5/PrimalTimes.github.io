Recent advances in generative modeling have revolutionized how we approach discrete data generation. This comprehensive survey \cite{joshiTransformersAreGraph2025} provides an excellent overview of the current state of the field.

## Key Approaches

The paper explores various methodologies for generating discrete structures, from traditional statistical approaches to modern neural architectures. The authors provide both theoretical foundations and practical implementation strategies.

## Applications and Impact

These techniques have wide-ranging applications in natural language processing, graph generation, and combinatorial optimization problems.
