## Research Overview

My research focuses on advancing the theoretical foundations and practical applications of machine learning, with particular emphasis on generative modeling and creative AI systems.

## Current Research Interests

### Generative Modeling
Exploring novel architectures and training methodologies for generative models, including variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and diffusion models. My work investigates the theoretical properties of these models and their applications in creative domains.

### Graph Neural Networks
Developing new approaches for learning representations of graph-structured data, with applications in molecular modeling, social network analysis, and knowledge graphs. I am particularly interested in the intersection of graph neural networks and generative modeling.

### Computer Vision for Creative Applications
Investigating how computer vision techniques can be adapted for creative and artistic applications, including animation, style transfer, and content generation. My recent work includes frame interpolation for anime and style-consistent image generation.

## Research Projects

### GraphVAE: Variational Autoencoders for Graph-Structured Data
This project explores the application of variational autoencoders to graph-structured data, developing new encoder and decoder architectures that can effectively capture the complex relationships inherent in graph structures. The work addresses fundamental challenges in graph generation and representation learning.

**Key Contributions:**
- Novel graph encoder architecture that preserves topological properties
- Theoretical analysis of the latent space structure for graph data
- Empirical evaluation on molecular and social network datasets

### AnimeInbet: Deep Learning for Animation Frame Interpolation
Developing specialized neural network architectures for frame interpolation in anime and cartoon-style animation. This work addresses the unique challenges posed by the distinct visual characteristics of animated content, including sharp edges, flat colors, and stylized motion.

**Technical Approach:**
- Custom loss functions tailored for cartoon-style imagery
- Multi-scale temporal modeling for smooth motion interpolation
- Style-preserving mechanisms to maintain artistic consistency

### Optimal Transport in Machine Learning
Comprehensive investigation of optimal transport theory and its applications in modern machine learning. This work includes both theoretical analysis and practical implementations, with particular focus on Wasserstein distances and their use in generative modeling.

**Research Areas:**
- Computational aspects of optimal transport
- Applications in generative adversarial networks
- Connections to variational inference

## Publications & Presentations


## Research Environment

Currently conducting research at the University of Tokyo's Graduate School of Engineering, with access to state-of-the-art computational resources and collaboration opportunities with leading researchers in machine learning and AI.

## Future Directions

Looking ahead, I plan to expand my research into areas such as multimodal learning, foundation models, and the intersection of AI with creative industries. I am particularly interested in developing AI systems that can serve as collaborative tools for human creativity rather than replacements.

## Collaboration & Contact

I am always interested in discussing research ideas and potential collaborations. If you are working on related topics or have interesting problems that might benefit from machine learning approaches, please feel free to reach out.
