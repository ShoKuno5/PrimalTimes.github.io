  So what am I contemplating? 

  Perhaps it unfolds like this:

  We have a structure, around the structure there exists mass. So a person might be understood as a skeletal framework with local information distributed around that skeleton. 
  Yes, it's somewhat inelegant that we focus on the local rather than the global—because the true elegance emerges when we collapse the global to a singular point. But let's begin here anyway. It is fundamentally a skeletal structure with different data spaces attached. The connections, the edges, with their interactions—but inhabiting different vector spaces, and interaction manifesting as vector mappings. 

  This is sheaf theory, apparently. 

  The other fascination pulling at me is the physics of language models. The way we consider, the way we think—it's simply defined dynamics over a network. What kind of networks? Networks of semantics, of mind. We need to uncover their nature. 

  These are the two threads, primarily concerning the morphism of structure.
  Yet they speak to an integrated form of cognition, whether perceived through vision or language.
