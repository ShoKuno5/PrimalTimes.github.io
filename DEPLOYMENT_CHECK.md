# GitHub Pages Deployment Checklist

Please verify these items to help me diagnose the issue:

## 1. Check GitHub Repository
Go to: https://github.com/shokuno5/shokuno5.github.io

- [ ] Confirm the repository exists
- [ ] Check if the latest commit includes "Fix GitHub Pages deployment"

## 2. Check GitHub Actions
Go to: https://github.com/shokuno5/shokuno5.github.io/actions

- [ ] Are there any workflow runs?
- [ ] If yes, did they succeed (green checkmark) or fail (red X)?
- [ ] Click on the latest run to see details

## 3. Check GitHub Pages Settings
Go to: https://github.com/shokuno5/shokuno5.github.io/settings/pages

- [ ] Source: Should be "GitHub Actions"
- [ ] Is there a green checkmark saying "Your site is live at..."?

## 4. Common Issues:

### If no workflow runs:
The .github/workflows/deploy.yml file might not be pushed yet.

### If workflow failed:
Check the error message in the Actions tab.

### If Pages shows "Deploy from a branch":
Change it to "GitHub Actions" and save.

## Quick Fix Commands:

```bash
# 1. Rebuild the site
npm run build

# 2. Add all changes
git add -A

# 3. Commit
git commit -m "Fix deployment and add test page"

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

After pushing, wait 2-5 minutes and check:
- https://shokuno5.github.io/test.html (should show test page)
- https://shokuno5.github.io/ (should show your portfolio)
