# Code Optimization Review

## Code Quality Analysis
- Reviewed ML code examples in blog posts
- Identified opportunities for modern PyTorch best practices

## Suggested Improvements
- Add type hints to function signatures
- Use torch.nn.functional for better performance
- Include GPU acceleration hints
- Add proper error handling for model loading

## Modern PyTorch Template
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from typing import Tuple, Optional

def forward_pass(model: nn.Module, x: torch.Tensor, 
                device: Optional[str] = None) -> torch.Tensor:
    """Forward pass with proper device handling."""
    if device:
        model = model.to(device)
        x = x.to(device)
    return model(x)
```
